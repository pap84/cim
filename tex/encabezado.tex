%%%%%%% Demo of section head containing sample macro:
%% To get a macro to expand correctly in a section head, with upper and
%% lower case math, put the definition and set the box 
%% before \begin{document}, so that when it appears in the 
%% table of contents it will also work:

\newcommand{\VT}[1]{\ensuremath{{V_{T#1}}}}

%% use a box to expand the macro before we put it into the section head:

\newbox\sectsavebox
\setbox\sectsavebox=\hbox{\boldmath\VT{xyz}}
